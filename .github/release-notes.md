## 2.22.7 Aliyun carrier DNS no-op update handling

- Confirms the existing carrier record's line, address, and TTL when Aliyun returns `DomainRecordDuplicate` for an unchanged update.
- Treats the response as success only when the provider record already matches the requested state; real conflicts still remain visible.
- Changes no schema, Agent, tunnel, forward, port, or health-check policy. Roll back to `2.22.6` with `sudo /usr/local/sbin/flux-panel-manager rollback` if needed.

## 2.22.6 idempotent Aliyun carrier DNS sync

- Identifies existing Aliyun carrier records by `LineCode`, including records whose display line is localized.
- Recovers from `DomainRecordDuplicate` by discovering and updating the existing record instead of leaving the strategy in an error state.
- Serializes strategy saves with scheduled health checks so both paths cannot recreate the same carrier records concurrently.
- Changes no schema, Agent, tunnel, forward, port, or health-check policy. Roll back to `2.22.5` with `sudo /usr/local/sbin/flux-panel-manager rollback` if needed.

## 2.22.5 Aliyun DNS request encoding fix

- Sends the pre-encoded Aliyun RPC query as a `URI`, preventing Spring from encoding `%3A` into `%253A`.
- Fixes the remaining `InvalidTimeStamp.Format` response after fractional seconds were removed.
- Changes no schema, Agent, tunnel, forward, port, or health-check behavior. Roll back to `2.22.4` with `sudo /usr/local/sbin/flux-panel-manager rollback` if needed.

## 2.22.4 Aliyun DNS signature timestamp fix

- Formats Aliyun DNS API timestamps without fractional seconds, as required by the 2015-01-09 API.
- Fixes `InvalidTimeStamp.Format` when carrier-line records are created or updated.
- Changes no schema, Agent, tunnel, forward, port, or health-check behavior. Roll back to `2.22.3` with `sudo /usr/local/sbin/flux-panel-manager rollback` if needed.

## 2.22.3 Aliyun carrier DNS diagnostics

- Uses Aliyun DNS's 600-second minimum TTL when creating or updating carrier-line records.
- Preserves Aliyun's API error code and short message so credential, permission, signature, domain, and record-limit failures can be diagnosed from the panel.
- Changes no schema, Agent, tunnel, forward, port, or health-check behavior. Roll back to `2.22.2` with `sudo /usr/local/sbin/flux-panel-manager rollback` if needed.

## 2.22.2 DNS credential autofill protection

- Prevents browser password managers from treating DNS configuration fields as panel login username/password fields.
- Gives Cloudflare, DNSPod, and Aliyun credential inputs distinct field names and marks secrets as new credentials in both DNS settings surfaces.
- Adds no schema, Agent, port, container, or DNS behavior changes. Roll back to `2.22.1` with `sudo /usr/local/sbin/flux-panel-manager rollback` if needed.

## 2.22.1 unified DNS provider settings

- Adds DNSPod and Aliyun DNS credential management directly to **DNS 与域名**, alongside the existing Cloudflare account and Zone management.
- Opens the carrier-DNS credential dialog directly when **入口接入** has no compatible provider, instead of sending administrators to an unrelated default tab.
- Reuses the existing encrypted provider records and APIs, so credentials already added under Dynamic DNS appear automatically and are not duplicated.
- This is a frontend workflow correction. It adds no database columns, Agent workload, listening ports, containers, or DNS changes by itself.

### Upgrade and rollback impact

- Existing Cloudflare, DNSPod, Aliyun DNS, Dynamic DNS, and carrier-entry configurations are preserved.
- Back up before updating as usual. To return to `2.22.0`, run `sudo /usr/local/sbin/flux-panel-manager rollback`.

## 2.22.0 carrier-aware entry routing

- Adds an administrator-only **入口接入** page that publishes one business hostname through default, China Telecom, China Unicom, and China Mobile DNS lines.
- Reuses encrypted DNSPod or Aliyun DNS credentials from Dynamic DNS; Cloudflare authoritative DNS is intentionally excluded because it does not provide mainland-China carrier line records.
- Requires all selected forwards to expose the same public port, while enforcing distinct entry forwards and entry nodes for meaningful carrier routing.
- Adds bounded Agent-online and TCP-port health checks. An unhealthy carrier entry falls back to a healthy default or alternate entry, and returns only after the configured recovery confirmations.
- Records concise switch and recovery history without reading or storing client IP addresses. DNS changes affect new connections only; established TCP connections are not migrated.

### Upgrade and rollback impact

- Adds three independent tables: `smart_entry_group`, `smart_entry_route`, and `smart_entry_event`. Existing nodes, tunnels, forwards, port allocations, domains, users, and Agent configurations are not rewritten.
- No Agent update, new container, listening port, or permanent probe host is required. Health checks run from the panel at a minimum five-second interval and are bounded to configured entry ports.
- Records created by Flux are deleted when a strategy is removed. Pre-existing carrier records are restored to their original address and TTL instead of being deleted.
- Back up MySQL before updating. To return to `2.21.0`, run `sudo /usr/local/sbin/flux-panel-manager rollback`; the previous panel safely ignores the additive tables and Flux restores managed DNS records when a strategy is deleted before rollback.

## 2.21.0 server assets and dynamic DNS

- Adds an administrator-only server asset center for provider, region, hardware, IP/ASN, network line, traffic plan, purchase and expiry dates, tags, notes, and per-currency monthly cost totals.
- Adds configurable Telegram expiry reminders. Each configured reminder day is delivered once for that asset and expiry date.
- Adds dynamic DNS rules for Cloudflare, DNSPod, and Aliyun DNS with IPv4/IPv6 detection, configurable polling intervals, update history, alert-center incidents, and one-shot Telegram failure/recovery notices.
- Reuses Cloudflare accounts and zones already stored under DNS settings. Additional DNS credentials are encrypted at rest and are never returned by list APIs or sent to Agents.
- Adds Agent `PublicIpQuery`; the Agent returns only its detected public address, while the panel performs all DNS API updates.

### Upgrade and rollback impact

- Adds four independent tables and two Telegram preference columns. Existing nodes, tunnels, forwards, port allocations, users, private proxies, internal mappings, domains, and certificates are not rewritten.
- Server assets add no Agent workload. Dynamic DNS performs one short address lookup per enabled rule at its configured interval, with a minimum of 30 seconds and a default of 60 seconds.
- Dynamic DNS requires Agent `2.21.0` on the selected detection node. Existing panel features continue working with older Agents.
- Back up MySQL before updating. To return to the previous successful panel release, run `sudo /usr/local/sbin/flux-panel-manager rollback`. The previous panel ignores the additive tables; dynamic DNS stops running and the last successfully written DNS record remains at the provider.

## 2.19.1 private proxy compatibility fix

- Generates private-proxy service and admission identifiers before the first database insert, fixing creation on strict MySQL 5.7 and MySQL 8 installations.
- Keeps Agent `2.19.0` as the minimum version; this panel-only fix does not require another Agent restart.

## 2.19.0 private proxy, diagnostics, and panel rollback

- Adds authenticated SOCKS5 and HTTP private proxies on owned or shared nodes, with optional source CIDR allowlists and permanent or timed leases.
- Integrates proxy listeners into the global port ledger and user forward quotas. Proxy traffic is charged to the user and the relevant owned/shared node quota; exhausted quotas pause only the affected proxy.
- Keeps ports reserved when an offline Agent cannot remove a proxy, then retries cleanup after that node reconnects.
- Adds an administrator-only network toolbox for bounded Ping, TCP, DNS, and traceroute checks executed by a selected Agent without accepting arbitrary shell commands.
- Encrypts proxy passwords at rest and never returns them through list APIs.
- Adds `flux-panel-manager rollback`, which switches to the previous successful panel image and restores the current image automatically if the rollback target fails health checks.

### Upgrade and rollback impact

- Adds only the `private_proxy` table. Existing nodes, tunnels, forwards, internal mappings, domains, users, and port allocations are not rewritten.
- Existing features continue working with older Agents; private proxies and network diagnostics require Agent 2.19.0 on the selected node.
- No new panel container or persistent probe is added. Proxy traffic consumes resources on its selected node, while diagnostics run only when requested and have bounded time and output.
- Back up MySQL before updating. To return to the previous successful panel release, run `sudo /usr/local/sbin/flux-panel-manager rollback`. Version 2.18.0 safely ignores the additive table, but remove active private proxies before rollback so the older panel is not left unable to manage their Agent-side listeners.

## 2.18.0 fast Agent recovery

- Starts Linux Agents after the basic network stack is available instead of waiting for `network-online.target` to finish.
- Retries panel connections every 1-1.5 seconds during a bounded 30-second recovery window, then returns to a jittered 5-6 second interval.
- Reduces the WebSocket connection handshake timeout from 10 seconds to 3 seconds so an unreachable panel address does not block the next attempt.
- Uses unlimited service restart attempts with a one-second delay on systemd and non-blocking network dependencies on Alpine/OpenRC.
- Repairs legacy Flux-managed systemd and OpenRC service definitions automatically after an Agent upgrade, without overwriting unrelated custom services.

## 2.17.2 display fix

- Gives the full-chain topology canvas an explicit responsive height so percentage sizing resolves correctly in desktop and mobile flex layouts.
- Runs automatic framing after the graph nodes are rendered.
- Lowers the overview zoom floor for large installations so the complete graph remains reachable before the operator zooms into a chain.

## Managed HTTPS

- Adds Cloudflare DNS-01 certificate issuance and automatic renewal through the centralized DNS credential store.
- Creates DNS-only A/AAAA records and temporary ACME TXT records without requiring public port 80.
- Encrypts ACME account keys, private keys, and certificate chains at rest and deploys them through the encrypted Agent channel.
- Supports multiple exact SNI certificates on one public HTTPS listener and routes HTTP/1.1 requests to existing internal mappings.
- Reports certificate expiry, issuance failures, renewal failures, and deployment failures through the alert center and Telegram notifications.

## Full-chain topology

- Visualizes users, domains, public entries, forwards, tunnels, nodes, connectors, and internal targets in one interactive graph.
- Colors failed components and links from live Agent state and configuration health.
- Includes a focused abnormal view, automatic layout, zoom controls, minimap, and navigation to each resource page.
- Applies role-aware filtering so ordinary users only see their own business chains.

## Upgrade impact

- Creates one certificate table and adds nullable fields to existing domain routes; it does not rewrite nodes, tunnels, forwards, port allocations, or users.
- Existing features and TLS passthrough continue to work with older Agents. Managed HTTPS requires Agent 2.17.0 on the selected public entry node.
- Certificate maintenance uses bounded scheduled retries and does not add a new container or permanent probing process.
- Upgrade the standby entry first when using production failover because restarting an Agent can interrupt connections on that node.

## 2.20.0 Shadowsocks and VLESS+REALITY private proxies

- Adds one-click Shadowsocks services with AES-128-GCM, AES-256-GCM, or ChaCha20-IETF-Poly1305 and TCP+UDP on one public port.
- Adds one-click VLESS+REALITY services with Agent-generated UUID, X25519 keys, Short ID, and import URI.
- Downloads Xray `v26.3.27` on demand from the official XTLS release, verifies its published SHA-256, binds Xray to localhost, and restores configured instances after Agent restart.
- Keeps client secrets out of list APIs and decrypts connection details only for the owning user or administrator when requested.
- Extends the global port ledger, pause/resume/delete lifecycle, traffic accounting, quota enforcement, offline cleanup, and source CIDR allowlists to both protocols.

### Upgrade and rollback impact

- Adds one nullable encrypted client-configuration column to `private_proxy`; no existing node, tunnel, forward, mapping, domain, user, or port-allocation row is rewritten.
- Shadowsocks adds no new runtime. Each REALITY instance adds one Xray process, and the first instance on a node caches roughly 20-30 MB of runtime files.
- Existing services continue working on older Agents. VLESS+REALITY specifically requires Agent `2.20.0`.
- Back up MySQL before updating. A failed panel deployment can roll back directly to 2.19.1. After creating a Shadowsocks or VLESS+REALITY instance, delete it before rollback when possible, then run `sudo /usr/local/sbin/flux-panel-manager rollback`; the previous panel safely ignores the additive column but cannot manage a 2.20.0-only Agent runtime.

## 2.20.1 Mobile protocol selector layout

- Keeps the full Shadowsocks and VLESS+REALITY labels on desktop while using compact `SS` and `VLESS` labels on narrow screens.
- Removes horizontal overflow from the private-proxy creation dialog without changing the 2.20.0 Agent protocol or database format.

## 2.20.2 VLESS+REALITY schema compatibility

- Expands the existing `private_proxy.proxy_type` column from 12 to 32 characters so upgraded installations can store the `vless_reality` protocol identifier.
- The migration is additive and preserves all existing private proxy records. Startup only alters older columns that are shorter than 32 characters.
