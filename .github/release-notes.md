## 2.18.0 fast Agent recovery

- Starts Linux Agents after the basic network stack is available instead of waiting for `network-online.target` to finish.
- Retries panel connections every 1-1.5 seconds during a bounded 30-second recovery window, then returns to a jittered 5-6 second interval.
- Reduces the WebSocket connection handshake timeout from 10 seconds to 3 seconds so an unreachable panel address does not block the next attempt.
- Uses unlimited service restart attempts with a one-second delay on systemd and non-blocking network dependencies on Alpine/OpenRC.
- Repairs legacy Flux-managed systemd and OpenRC service definitions automatically after an Agent upgrade, without overwriting unrelated custom services.

## 2.17.2 display fix

- Gives the full-chain topology canvas an explicit responsive height so percentage sizing resolves correctly in desktop and mobile flex layouts.
- Runs automatic framing after the graph nodes are rendered.
- Lowers the overview zoom floor for large installations so the complete graph remains reachable before the operator zooms into a chain.

## Managed HTTPS

- Adds Cloudflare DNS-01 certificate issuance and automatic renewal through the centralized DNS credential store.
- Creates DNS-only A/AAAA records and temporary ACME TXT records without requiring public port 80.
- Encrypts ACME account keys, private keys, and certificate chains at rest and deploys them through the encrypted Agent channel.
- Supports multiple exact SNI certificates on one public HTTPS listener and routes HTTP/1.1 requests to existing internal mappings.
- Reports certificate expiry, issuance failures, renewal failures, and deployment failures through the alert center and Telegram notifications.

## Full-chain topology

- Visualizes users, domains, public entries, forwards, tunnels, nodes, connectors, and internal targets in one interactive graph.
- Colors failed components and links from live Agent state and configuration health.
- Includes a focused abnormal view, automatic layout, zoom controls, minimap, and navigation to each resource page.
- Applies role-aware filtering so ordinary users only see their own business chains.

## Upgrade impact

- Creates one certificate table and adds nullable fields to existing domain routes; it does not rewrite nodes, tunnels, forwards, port allocations, or users.
- Existing features and TLS passthrough continue to work with older Agents. Managed HTTPS requires Agent 2.17.0 on the selected public entry node.
- Certificate maintenance uses bounded scheduled retries and does not add a new container or permanent probing process.
- Upgrade the standby entry first when using production failover because restarting an Agent can interrupt connections on that node.
